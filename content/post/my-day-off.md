A wonderful day off I've had so far, and I'm only an hour past noon! Watch my fill of YouTube videos while reading the last couple hundred pages of *The Ring of Five Dragons* , an old fantasy novel I picked up during a vacation a while back. Perhaps I have grander things I dream of doing with my time, but a day off is for rest regardless of my desire.

## YouTube Interests

I won't bore you in this my second ever post with every single subscription my account holds because today held a topic in which I don't normally indulge: **Architecture**. If you've known me for any length of time, I've probably told you about the latest video game or book in my collection ( I've held true to that without even meaning in my introduction today ). What doesn't surface in my everyday conversation is a desire to build my own home and accordingly desire for the architectural knowledge to do so.

The channel *Stewart Hicks* landed in my recommendations with a video nearing a million views thanks to the viral boost. But I just kept watching more of them. Specific buildings, general topics of discussion, mostly I get focused in on housing with energy conservation in mind. Why would you try and make a wasteful house anyway? Find the constraints of your life and your space, but still keep in mind the natural resources of sun, wind, and rain so that they can be harnessed instead of cursed.

## The Novel

The element of *The Ring of Five Dragons* that I found most resonant was the internal struggle with identity. While the character in the story is literally containing two persons experiences and reactions, it is easily simplified for discussion into a struggle between the dualities I consider each day such as masculine vs feminine or good vs evil. But really we are both, every feeling we have is real. Contradiction isn't a proper way to handle emotions, instead look for acceptance and find the wise path among both sides. I could keep concocting aphorisms for you but hopefully I made my point.

Of note when checking out the author, he was writing this series before taking over the Bourne series of books.

## Actual Plans for this Month

Gonna make a Godot app. Not promising a game, it's mostly to teach me UI in Godot instead of full game development. Just like making a website was for January, making an application using Godot is the plan for February. If it goes well I will stick with it and learn more elements of the Godot engine because I would love to have a good game in my portfolio.

Also just like this website, I have not started yet and we are half way through the shortest month of the year. So instead of treating the end of the month as the deadline and waiting to crunch my way to the finished product I will get it started tomorrow and hopefully done before the new Theatrhythm game comes out next Thursday.
