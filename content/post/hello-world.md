Hello World! Yes I have my website up and running, or I did - how else would you have received this message ( an archive perhaps? ). Well maybe you can tell I've spent the last few days coding this site and not playing video games or reading. I keep wanting to write my sentences as incredibly long run-on sentences, but my writers brain is catching up to me and making me use somewhat proper punctuation.

Coherent thoughts too.

See.

I wanted to put the "coherent thoughts" in that sentence but I thought too long and had to separate it for clarity.

Change of pace even.

I don't want to spend too long on this first post that will mark the end of what I can only imagine will be an incredibly long and illustrious list of my moaning and musing.
