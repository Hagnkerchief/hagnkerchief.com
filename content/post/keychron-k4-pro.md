Bought myself a new keyboard -finally- to encourage this sort of writing with the improved acoustics and performance of the Keychron K4 Pro over my old Corsair that I'm not going to bother to look up the name of.

## Acoustics

Some might criticize my choice of Brown switches for my keyboards, but at least this keyboard is hot swap so when I find a specialty switch that I really desire I can reuse this body. the K4 Pro has foam and silicon filling in the inside of the body. I couldn't tell you which is for the sound and which is for the comfort of the typing on the keys, but I love it either way. Only key that is bothering me is the spacebar, but that might be because I read other reviews that mentioned the spacebar had a different sound from the rest of the keys. Probably something to do with longer stabilizers but it's still and improvement over my old keyboard.

## Size

Not going to measure for myself or pull up the specifications. Suffice it to say the reduction in the number of keys on this board by at least 3 has given me more room for my mouse on my desk and made it small enough to fit in my bag. That's right, I will be putting a mechanical keyboard in my everyday bag so that I may type into my phone on lunch breaks or maybe in the car. Should still find a better on screen keyboard for the rest of the time, but the K4 Pro gives me a better typing experience that inspires me to write.

## Bottom Line

I love this keyboard. It's still only my second mechanical keyboard and my first hot swap when I haven't even customized it at all. Unless it falls apart really soon I don't have much reason to go looking for the next typing experience. I'll be happy to keep writing to you all from here.
