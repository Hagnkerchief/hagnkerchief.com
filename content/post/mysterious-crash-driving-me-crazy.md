I thought I had it figured out yesterday. Finally tried a hardware fix of changing my RAM and it was working the rest of the day. It even worked until about an hour ago. Then it crashed again with the same error codes.

## Honkai Star Rail and Genshin Impact

I've been having so much fun with their story and gameplay... but this crash has broken me. I'm not remembering all the cool fights or the characters that I like, I'm remembering that everytime I play it crashes and I spend hours reading the same support threads and still not fixing the damn thing. At least when the fixes didn't work immediatly I could stay even tempered. Having the RAM change work for a whole 24 hours got me so excited to enjoy the game only to have it torn away again.

## More Hardware Fixes to Try

I won't be going as far to try and replace my motherboard... at least not yet. Since I see firmware tpm errors that are seemingly common for my hardware I have purchased a physical tpm to arrive tomorrow. Who knows how long that fix will last, I just want to have fun. Can't even bring myself to try to do Blender or Godot because it sure seems like it's an instability with my hardware and I will get more sad and upset if I find additional programs that will crash while I'm trying to have fun.

Anyway its about time I try to make a dinner that will fill the stress in my life.
